	/* Let a[i] be the number of binary strings of length i which do not contain any two consecutive 1â€™s and which end in 0. 
	 * Similarly, let b[i] be the number of such strings which end in 1. We can append either 0 or 1 to a string ending in 0, 
	 * but we can only append 0 to a string ending in 1. This yields the recurrence relation
	 * a[i] = a[i - 1] + b[i - 1]
	 * b[i] = a[i - 1] 
	 * The base cases of above recurrence are a[1] = b[1] = 1. The total number of strings of length i is just a[i] + b[i].
	 * 
	 * Now we just need to subtract those strings whose value is greater than num
	 * 
	 * we iterate from the MSB to LSB of num:
	 * 
	 * if bit[i] == 1
	 * if bit[i + 1] == 0, i.e. 10** there's no solutions in res that is larger than num, we go further into smaller bit and subtract.
	 * if bit[i + 1] == 1, i.e 11** we know in those res solutions it won't have any consecutive ones. when bit[i + 1] == 1, 
	 * in one[i + 1], the i-th bit in valid solutions must be 0, which are all smaller than 'num', 
	 * we don't need to check smaller bits and subtract, so we break form the loop.
	 * 
	 * if bit[i] == 0
	 * if bit[i + 1] == 1, i.e 01*** there's no solutions in res that is larger than num, we go further into smaller bit and subtract.
	 * if bit[i + 1] == 0, i.e 00*** we know zero[i + 1] includes solutions of i-th == 0 (00***) and i-th bit == 1 (01***), 
	 * we know the i-th bit of num is 0, so we need to subtract all the 01*** solutions because it is larger than num. 
	 * Therefore, one[i] is subtracted from res.
	 * Time 0(n)
