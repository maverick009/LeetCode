/*
 * You're given an array of positive integers and are allowed to change the sign of any of the integers 
 * whenever you require. Write a program to calculate the minimum sum of this array. This sum should be >= 0. 
 * For example : Array = {1,2,4,5} then sum = 0 as we change sign of 1 and 5 {-1,2,4,-5}
 * 
 * Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum problem
